# memorizer

Memorizer is an art-project by Tymur Soroka featuring the idea of a self-forgetting book by Daria Platonova.

It includes a Python-based app that is able of processing short texts similarly to the human's memory. 
The executable file is stored at *dist/main_window.exe*

"Open" function will be working soon. For now, you can upload your texts to the *test.txt* file under the same directory as an executable.
