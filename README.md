# memorizer

Memorizer is an art-project by Tymur Soroka featuring the idea of Daria Platonova.

It includes a Python-based app that is able of processing short texts similarly to the human's memory. 
In the nearest future it will have an executable file included. But until that time you can try it out if you have **Python 3** installed on your PC.
Just launch the **main.py** file.
